        <p> Once when I was in high school. Me and my friend went to a school's shop.
            I went to the snacks and sweets section and decided to brought up a pack of candies.
            I showed the candies to my friend who is from across the shop. A second later, my
            hand slipped and the candies fell and shattered on the floor.My friend who saw everything
            laugh and so do I. After that, I have to bought the candies since I broke them.
